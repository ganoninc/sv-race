# SV-Race - Google Street View Race
A simple race game in Google Street View
## The idea
The idea is to make a point & click race game that uses Google Street View.
Two online players (or more) would start at a the same start point and they would have to find the arrival point as fast as they can.

## Features
The start and the end of the race would be randomly determined. 

They could get some help from objects/jokers like in Mario Kart serie.

A live map would be displayed to help the players. 

A background music could be played and the game could have some sound effects.

## Technologies
The game is a in web browser game, so it will use Javascript and HTML5 technologies.
